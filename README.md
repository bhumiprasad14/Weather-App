# Weather App
 The Weather App is a simple yet functional web application that provides real-time weather information for any location worldwide. The app uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and interactive experience. Users can input the name of a city, and the app will fetch the current weather data for that location from a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap) and display the results in an easy-to-read format.
